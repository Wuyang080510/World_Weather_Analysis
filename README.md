# World_Weather_Analysis

In this project, I conducted weather analysis and provided technical supports for PlanMyTrip APP, a hypothetical travel technology company, with Python, Open Weather MapAPI, and Google Places API. 

With my work, customers can:
- Filter the search results based on their preferred travel criteria
- Find their ideal hotel anywhere via the search page
- View hotel and real-time weather information of vacation destinations on a map
- View the travel itinerary map in the app
